    <p>
      This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece. It will make you belly laugh, it
      will chill you to the bone, and it will make you shed a tear. This movie
      will stay with you long after the credits are over.

    <p>
      A science-fiction masterpiece. Nolan executes a marvelous direction that
      slowly but efficiently puts in place a dark world creating a necessity to
      save humanity. Add to that great performances from Nolan and Hathaway plus
      a great score from Hans Zimmer. The result is on the best science-fiction
      movies of all time.

    <h3>Everything Everywhere All at Once</h3>

    <p>
      Profoundly deep, genuinely moving, utterly hilarious, highly imaginative
      and a visual feast. Haven't laughed this hard, cried this much or thought
      so deeply about any film in 2022 Much less all in the same viewing. This
      was indeed everything, everywhere all at once.
